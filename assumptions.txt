For the purposes of saving time and simplicity, I have made the following assumptions:

1. There is an unlimited amounts of bank money
2. There is no free parking money
3. If a player has a get out of jail free card, it will be used automatically.
4. When player is in jail and has greater than $200, then he will pay the $50 fee. Otherwise, he will have to roll doubles.
5. A player cannot roll again after rolling doubles leaving jail under no circumstances.
